# Product Table
## Date:
## Objective:

To create a structured HTML table that displays product-related information, including product names, prices, and descriptions, useful for catalogs, listings, or e-commerce prototypes.

## Tasks:

### 1. Set Up the Basic HTML Structure:

Use ```<!DOCTYPE html>```, ```<html>```, ```<head>```, and ```<body>``` tags to define the document layout.

Include a ```<title>``` such as "Product Table".

### 2. Create a Table Element:

Use the ```<table>``` tag to begin the product table.

### 3. Add a Table Header:

Use the ```<thead>``` section with a ```<tr>``` row and three ```<th>``` elements:

Product Name

Product Price

Description

### 4. Insert Table Body Rows:

Use the ```<tbody>``` section with multiple ```<tr>``` rows.

In each row, use three ```<td>``` cells for:

The name of the product (e.g., Laptop, Phone)

The price (e.g., â‚¹45,000, $499)

A short description (e.g., "High-speed performance", "Budget-friendly")

### 5. Ensure Semantic Structure:

Include ```<caption>``` if needed to describe the table purpose.

Use meaningful text inside the table for clarity.

### 6. No CSS or JavaScript:

Keep the table design strictly in HTML for simplicity.
## HTML Code:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>PRODUCT TABLE</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <table cellspacing="5" cellpadding="4" border="3" bgcolor="lightblue">
            <caption>PRODUCT DETAILS</caption>
            <thead bgcolor="lightpink">
                <tr>
                    <th>Product Name</th>
                    <th>Product Price</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Pizza</td>
                    <td>250</td>
                    <td>Cheesy and spicy</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Burger</td>
                    <td>120</td>
                    <td>Crispy veggie patty</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Pasta</td>
                    <td>180</td>
                    <td>Creamy White Sauce</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
    </body>
